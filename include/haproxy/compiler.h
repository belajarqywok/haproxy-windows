/*********************** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ALIGNMENT **********************\

 * members by propagating the alignment to the container struct itself,      *
 * but this requires that variables of the affected type are properly        *
 * aligned themselves. While regular variables will always abide, those      *
 * allocated using malloc() will not! Most platforms provide posix_memalign()*
 * for this, but it's not available everywhere. As such one ought not to use *
 * these alignment declarations inside structures that are dynamically       *
 * allocated. If the purpose is only to avoid false sharing of cache lines   *
 * for multi_threading, see THREAD_PAD() below.                              *
