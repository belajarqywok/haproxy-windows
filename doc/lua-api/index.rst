How Lua runs in HAProxy
=======================

HAProxy Lua running contexts
----------------------------

The Lua code executed in HAProxy can be processed in 2 main modes. The first one
is the **initialisation mode**, and the second is the **runtime mode**.

* In the **initialisation mode**, we can perform DNS solves, but we cannot
  perform socket I/O. In this initialisation mode, HAProxy still blocked during
  the execution of the Lua program.

* In the **runtime mode**, we cannot perform DNS solves, but we can use sockets.
  The execution of the Lua code is multiplexed with the requests processing, so
  the Lua code seems to be run in blocking, but it is not the case.

The Lua code is loaded in one or more files. These files contains main code and
functions. Lua has 8 execution contexts.

1. The Lua file **body context**. It is executed during the load of the Lua file
   in the HAProxy `[global]` section with the directive `lua-load`. It is
   executed in initialisation mode. This section is use for configuring Lua
   bindings in HAProxy.

2. The Lua **init context**. It is a Lua function executed just after the
   HAProxy configuration parsing. The execution is in initialisation mode. In
   this context the HAProxy environment are already initialized. It is useful to
   check configuration, or initializing socket connections or tasks. These
   functions are declared in the body context with the Lua function
   `core.register_init()`. The prototype of the function is a simple function
   without return value and without parameters, like this: `function fcn()`.

3. The Lua **task context**. It is a Lua function executed after the start
   of the HAProxy scheduler, and just after the declaration of the task with the
   Lua function `core.register_task()`. This context can be concurrent with the
   traffic processing. It is executed in runtime mode. The prototype of the
   function is a simple function without return value and without parameters,
   like this: `function fcn()`.

4. The **action context**. It is a Lua function conditionally executed. These
   actions are registered by the Lua directives "`core.register_action()`". The
   prototype of the Lua called function is a function with doesn't returns
   anything and that take an object of class TXN as entry. `function fcn(txn)`.

5. The **sample-fetch context**. This function takes a TXN object as entry
   argument and returns a string. These types of function cannot execute any
   blocking function. They are useful to aggregate some of original HAProxy
   sample-fetches and return the result. The prototype of the function is
   `function string fcn(txn)`. These functions can be registered with the Lua
   function `core.register_fetches()`. Each declared sample-fetch is prefixed by
   the string "lua.".

   .. note::
      It is possible that this function cannot found the required data in the
      original HAProxy sample-fetches, in this case, it cannot return the
      result. This case is not yet supported

6. The **converter context**. It is a Lua function that takes a string as input
   and returns another string as output. These types of function are stateless,
   it cannot access to any context. They don't execute any blocking function.
   The call prototype is `function string fcn(string)`. This function can be
   registered with the Lua function `core.register_converters()`. Each declared
   converter is prefixed by the string "lua.".

7. The **filter context**: It is a Lua object based on a class defining filter
   callback functions. Lua filters are registered using
   `core.register_filter()`. Each declared filter is prefixed by the string
   "lua.".

8. The **event context**: Inside a function that handles events subscribed
   through `core.event_sub()` or `Server.event_sub()`.


HAProxy Lua Hello world
-----------------------

HAProxy configuration file (`hello_world.conf`):

::

    global
       lua-load hello_world.lua

    listen proxy
       bind 127.0.0.1:10001
       tcp-request inspect-delay 1s
       tcp-request content use-service lua.hello_world

HAProxy Lua file (`hello_world.lua`):

.. code-block:: lua

    core.register_service("hello_world", "tcp", function(applet)
       applet:send("hello world\n")
    end)

How to start HAProxy for testing this configuration:

::

    ./haproxy -f hello_world.conf

On other terminal, you can test with telnet:

::

    #:~ telnet 127.0.0.1 10001
    hello world

Usage of load parameters
------------------------

HAProxy lua-load(-per-thread) directives allow a list of parameters after
the lua file name. These parameters are accessible through an array of args
using this code `local args = table.pack(...)` in the body of loaded file.

Below, a new version of the hello world using load parameters

HAProxy configuration file (`hello_world.conf`):

::

    global
       lua-load hello_world.lua "this is not an hello world"

    listen proxy
       bind 127.0.0.1:10001
       tcp-request inspect-delay 1s
       tcp-request content use-service lua.hello_world

HAProxy Lua file (`hello_world.lua`):

.. code-block:: lua

    local args = table.pack(...)

    core.register_service("hello_world", "tcp", function(applet)
       applet:send(args[1] .. "\n")
    end)


Core class
==========

.. js:class:: core

   The "core" class contains all the HAProxy core functions. These function are
   useful for the controlling of the execution flow, registering hooks,
   manipulating global maps or ACL, ...

   "core" class is basically provided with HAProxy. No `require` line is
   required to uses these function.

   The "core" class is static, it is not possible to create a new object of this
   type.

.. js:attribute:: core.emerg

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "emergency" (0).

.. js:attribute:: core.alert

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "alert" (1).

.. js:attribute:: core.crit

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "critical" (2).

.. js:attribute:: core.err

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "error" (3).

.. js:attribute:: core.warning

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "warning" (4).

.. js:attribute:: core.notice

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "notice" (5).

.. js:attribute:: core.info

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "info" (6).

.. js:attribute:: core.debug

  :returns: integer

  This attribute is an integer, it contains the value of the loglevel
  "debug" (7).

.. js:attribute:: core.proxies

  **context**: init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  This attribute is a table of declared proxies (frontend and backends). Each
  proxy give an access to his list of listeners and servers. The table is
  indexed by proxy name, and each entry is of type :ref:`proxy_class`.

  .. Warning::
     if you declared a frontend and backend with the same name, only one of
     them will be listed.

  :see: :js:attr:`core.backends`
  :see: :js:attr:`core.frontends`

.. js:attribute:: core.backends

  **context**: init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  This attribute is a table of declared proxies with backend capability. Each
  proxy give an access to his list of listeners and servers. The table is
  indexed by the backend name, and each entry is of type :ref:`proxy_class`.

  :see: :js:attr:`core.proxies`
  :see: :js:attr:`core.frontends`

.. js:attribute:: core.frontends

  **context**: init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  This attribute is a table of declared proxies with frontend capability. Each
  proxy give an access to his list of listeners and servers. The table is
  indexed by the frontend name, and each entry is of type :ref:`proxy_class`.

  :see: :js:attr:`core.proxies`
  :see: :js:attr:`core.backends`

.. js:attribute:: core.thread

  **context**: task, action, sample-fetch, converter, applet

  This variable contains the executing thread number starting at 1. 0 is a
  special case for the common lua context. So, if thread is 0, Lua scope is
  shared by all threads, otherwise the scope is dedicated to a single thread.
  A program which needs to execute some parts exactly once regardless of the
  number of threads can check that core.thread is 0 or 1.

.. js:function:: core.log(loglevel, msg)

  **context**: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  This function sends a log. The log is sent, according with the HAProxy
  configuration file, to the loggers relevant to the current context and
  to stderr if it is allowed.

  The exact behaviour depends on tune.lua.log.loggers and tune.lua.log.stderr.

  :param integer loglevel: Is the log level associated with the message. It is a
   number between 0 and 7.
  :param string msg: The log content.
  :see: :js:attr:`core.emerg`, :js:attr:`core.alert`, :js:attr:`core.crit`,
    :js:attr:`core.err`, :js:attr:`core.warning`, :js:attr:`core.notice`,
    :js:attr:`core.info`, :js:attr:`core.debug` (log level definitions)
  :see: :js:func:`core.Debug`
  :see: :js:func:`core.Info`
  :see: :js:func:`core.Warning`
  :see: :js:func:`core.Alert`

.. js:function:: core.Debug(msg)

  **context**: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  :param string msg: The log content.
  :see: :js:func:`core.log`

  Does the same job than:

  function Debug(msg)
    core.log(core.debug, msg)
  end
..

.. js:function:: core.Info(msg)

  **context**: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  :param string msg: The log content.
  :see: :js:func:`core.log`

.. code-block:: lua

  function Info(msg)

  referenced by his filename.

  :param string filename: the filename that reference the map entries.
  :param string key: the key which will be deleted.

.. js:function:: core.get_info()

  **context**: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  Returns HAProxy core information. We can find information like the uptime,
  the pid, memory pool usage, tasks number, ...

  This information is also returned by the management socket via the command
  "show info". See the management socket documentation for more information
  about the content of these variables.

  :returns: an array of values.

.. js:function:: core.now()

  **context**: body, init, task, action

  This function returns the current time. The time returned is fixed by the
  HAProxy core and assures than the hour will be monotonic and that the system
  call 'gettimeofday' will not be called too. The time is refreshed between each
  Lua execution or resume, so two consecutive call to the function "now" will
  probably returns the same result.

  :returns: a table which contains two entries "sec" and "usec". "sec"
   contains the current at the epoch format, and "usec" contains the
   current microseconds.

.. js:function:: core.http_date(date)

    registered with the 'http' value for the *mode* parameter will gets a
    :ref:`applethttp_class`. If the *mode* value is 'tcp', the applet will gets
    a :ref:`applettcp_class`.

  .. warning::
     Applets of type 'http' cannot be called from 'tcp-*' rulesets. Only the
     'http-*' rulesets are authorized, this means that is not possible to call
     a HTTP applet from a proxy in tcp mode. Applets of type 'tcp' can be
     called from anywhere.

  Here, an example of service registration. The service just send an
  'Hello world' as an http response.

.. code-block:: lua

  core.register_service("hello-world", "http", function(applet)
     local response = "Hello World !"
     applet:set_status(200)
     applet:add_header("content-length", string.len(response))
     applet:add_header("content-type", "text/plain")
     applet:start_response()

.. js:function:: core.event_sub(event_types, func)

  **context**: body, init, task, action, sample-fetch, converter

  Register a function that will be called on specific system events.

  :param array event_types: array of string containing the event types you want
   to subscribe to
  :param function func: is the Lua function called when one of the subscribed
   events occur.
  :returns: A :ref:`event_sub_class` object.
  :see: :js:func:`Server.event_sub()`.

  List of available event types :

   **SERVER** Family:

    * **SERVER_ADD**: when a server is added
    * **SERVER_DEL**: when a server is removed
    * **SERVER_DOWN**: when a server state goes from UP to DOWN
    * **SERVER_UP**: when a server state goes from DOWN to UP
    * **SERVER_STATE**: when a server state changes
    * **SERVER_ADMIN**: when a server administrative state changes
    * **SERVER_CHECK**: when a server's check status change is reported.
      Be careful when subscribing to this type since many events might be
      generated.

   .. Note::
     Use **SERVER** in **event_types** to subscribe to all server events types
     at once. Note that this should only be used for testing purposes since a
     single event source could result in multiple events types being generated.
     (e.g.: SERVER_STATE will always be generated for each SERVER_DOWN or
     SERVER_UP)

  The prototype of the Lua function used as argument is:

.. code-block:: lua

    function(event, event_data, sub, when)
..

  * **event** (*string*): the event type (one of the **event_types** specified
    when subscribing)
  * **event_data**: specific to each event family (For **SERVER** family,
    a :ref:`server_event_class` object)
  * **sub**: class to manage the subscription from within the event
    (a :ref:`event_sub_class` object)
  * **when**: timestamp corresponding to the date when the event was generated.
    It is an integer representing the number of seconds elapsed since Epoch.
    It may be provided as optional argument to `os.date()` lua function to
    convert it to a string according to a given format string.

  .. Warning::
    The callback function will only be scheduled on the very same thread that
    performed the subscription.

    Moreover, each thread treats events sequentially. It means that if you
    have, let's say SERVER_UP followed by a SERVER_DOWN in a short timelapse,
    then the cb function will first be called with SERVER_UP, and once it's
    done handling the event, the cb function will be called again with
    SERVER_DOWN.

    This is to ensure event consistency when it comes to logging / triggering
    logic from lua.

    Your lua cb function may yield if needed, but you're pleased to process the
    event as fast as possible to prevent the event queue from growing up,
    depending on the event flow that is expected for the given subscription.

    To prevent abuses, if the event queue for the current subscription goes
    over a certain amount of unconsumed events, the subscription will pause
    itself automatically for as long as it takes for your handler to catch up.
    This would lead to events being missed, so an error will be reported in the
    logs to warn you about that.
    This is not something you want to let happen too often, it may indicate
    that you subscribed to an event that is occurring too frequently or/and
    that your callback function is too slow to keep up the pace and you should
    review it.

    If you want to do some parallel processing because your callback functions
    are slow: you might want to create subtasks from lua using
    :js:func:`core.register_task()` from within your callback function to
    perform the heavy job in a dedicated task and allow remaining events to be
    processed more quickly.

.. js:function:: Server.event_sub(sv, event_types, func)

  Register a function that will be called on specific server events.
  It works exactly like :js:func:`core.event_sub()` except that the subscription
  will be performed within the server dedicated subscription list instead of the
  global one.
  (Your callback function will only be called for server events affecting sv)

  See :js:func:`core.event_sub()` for function usage.

  A key advantage to using :js:func:`Server.event_sub()` over
  :js:func:`core.event_sub()` for servers is that :js:func:`Server.event_sub()`
  allows you to be notified for servers events of a single server only.
  It removes the needs for extra filtering in your callback function if you only
  care about a single server, and also prevents useless wakeups.

  For instance, if you want to be notified for UP/DOWN events on a given set of
  servers, it is recommended to perform multiple per-server subscriptions since
  it will be more efficient that doing a single global subscription that will
  filter the received events.
  Unless you really want to be notified for servers events of ALL servers of
  course, which could make sense given you setup but should be avoided if you
  have an important number of servers as it will add a significant load on your
  haproxy process in case of multiple servers state change in a short amount of
  time.

  .. Note::
     You may also combine :js:func:`core.event_sub()` with
     :js:func:`Server.event_sub()`.

     Also, don't forget that you can use :js:func:`core.register_task()` from
     your callback function if needed. (ie: parallel work)

  Here is a working example combining :js:func:`core.event_sub()` with
  :js:func:`Server.event_sub()` and :js:func:`core.register_task()`
  (This only serves as a demo, this is not necessarily useful to do so)

.. code-block:: lua

  core.event_sub({"SERVER_ADD"}, function(event, data, sub)
    -- in the global event handler
    if data["reference"] ~= nil then
      print("Tracking new server: ", data["name"])
      data["reference"]:event_sub({"SERVER_UP", "SERVER_DOWN"}, function(event, data, sub)
        -- in the per-server event handler
	if data["reference"] ~= nil then
          core.register_task(function(server)
            -- subtask to perform some async work (e.g.: HTTP API calls, sending emails...)
            print("ASYNC: SERVER ", server:get_name(), " is ", event == "SERVER_UP" and "UP" or "DOWN")
          end, data["reference"])
        end
      end)
    end
  end)

..

  In this example, we will first track global server addition events.
  For each newly added server ("add server" on the cli), we will register a
  UP/DOWN server subscription.
  Then, the callback function will schedule the event handling in an async
  subtask which will receive the server reference as an argument.

.. js:attribute:: ServerEventAdmin.old_admin

  Previous server admin state prior to the admin change.

  Values are presented as in **new_admin**, but they should differ.
  (Comparing old and new helps to find out the change(s))

.. js:attribute:: ServerEventAdmin.requeued

  Same as :js:attr:`ServerEventState.requeued` but when the requeue is due to
  the server administrative state change.

.. _queue_class:

Queue class
===========

.. js:class:: Queue

  This class provides a generic FIFO storage mechanism that may be shared
  between multiple lua contexts to easily pass data between them, as stock
  Lua doesn't provide easy methods for passing data between multiple coroutines.

  inter-task example:

.. code-block:: lua

  -- script wide shared queue
  local queue = core.queue()

  -- master task
  core.register_task(function()
    -- send the date every second
    while true do
      queue:push(os.date("%c", core.now().sec))
      core.sleep(1)
    end
  end)

  -- worker task
  core.register_task(function()
    while true do
      -- print the date sent by master
      print(queue:pop_wait())
    end
  end)
..

  Of course, queue may also be used as a local storage mechanism.

  Use :js:func:`core.queue` to get a new Queue object.

.. js:function:: Queue.size(queue)

  This function returns the number of items within the Queue.

  :param class_queue queue: A :ref:`queue_class` to the current queue

.. js:function:: Queue.push(queue, item)

  This function pushes the item (may be of any type) to the queue.
  Pushed item cannot be nil or invalid, or an error will be thrown.

  :param class_queue queue: A :ref:`queue_class` to the current queue
  :returns: boolean true for success and false for error

.. js:function:: Queue.pop(queue)

  This function immediately tries to pop an item from the queue.
  It returns nil of no item is available at the time of the call.

  :param class_queue queue: A :ref:`queue_class` to the current queue
  :returns: the item at the top of the stack (any type) or nil if no items

.. js:function:: Queue.pop_wait(queue)

  **context**: task

  This is an alternative to pop() that may be used within task contexts.

  The call waits for data if no item is currently available. This may be
  useful when used in a while loop to prevent cpu waste.

  Note that this requires yielding, thus it is only available within contexts
  that support yielding (mainly task context).

  :param class_queue queue: A :ref:`queue_class` to the current queue
  :returns: the item at the top of the stack (any type) or nil in case of error

.. _concat_class:

Concat class
============

.. js:class:: Concat

  This class provides a fast way for string concatenation. The way using native
  Lua concatenation like the code below is slow for some reasons.

.. code-block:: lua

  str = "string1"
  str = str .. ", string2"
  str = str .. ", string3"
..

  For each concatenation, Lua:
  - allocates memory for the result,
  - catenates the two string copying the strings in the new memory block,
  - frees the old memory block containing the string which is no longer used.

  This process does many memory move, allocation and free. In addition, the
  memory is not really freed, it is just marked as unused and waits for the
  garbage collector.

  The Concat class provides an alternative way to concatenate strings. It uses
  the internal Lua mechanism (it does not allocate memory), but it doesn't copy
  the data more than once.

  On my computer, the following loops spends 0.2s for the Concat method and
  18.5s for the pure Lua implementation. So, the Concat class is about 1000x
  faster than the embedded solution.

.. code-block:: lua

  for j = 1, 100 do
    c = core.concat()
    for i = 1, 20000 do
      c:add("#####")
    end
  end
..

.. code-block:: lua

  for j = 1, 100 do
    c = ""
    for i = 1, 20000 do
      c = c .. "#####"
    end
  end
..

.. js:function:: Concat.add(concat, string)

  This function adds a string to the current concatenated string.

  :param class_concat concat: A :ref:`concat_class` which contains the currently
   built string.
  :param string string: A new string to concatenate to the current built
   string.

.. js:function:: Concat.dump(concat)

  This function returns the concatenated string.

  :param class_concat concat: A :ref:`concat_class` which contains the currently
   built string.
  :returns: the concatenated string

.. _fetches_class:

Fetches class
=============

.. js:class:: Fetches

  This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample fetches. See the
  HAProxy "configuration.txt" documentation for more information.
  (chapters 7.3.2 to 7.3.6)

  .. warning::
     some sample fetches are not available in some context. These limitations
     are specified in this documentation when they're useful.

  :see: :js:attr:`TXN.f`
  :see: :js:attr:`TXN.sf`

  Fetches are useful to:

  * get system time,
  * get environment variable,
  * get random numbers,
  * know backend status like the number of users in queue or the number of
    connections established,
  * get client information like ip source or destination,
  * deal with stick tables,
  * fetch established SSL information,
  * fetch HTTP information like headers or method.

.. code-block:: lua

  function action(txn)
    -- Get source IP
    local clientip = txn.f:src()
  end
..

.. _converters_class:

Converters class
================

.. js:class:: Converters

  This class contains a lot of internal HAProxy sample converters. See the
  HAProxy documentation "configuration.txt" for more information about her
  usage. Its the chapter 7.3.1.

  :see: :js:attr:`TXN.c`
  :see: :js:attr:`TXN.sc`

  Converters provides stateful transformation. They are useful to:

  * convert input to base64,
  * apply hash on input string (djb2, crc32, sdbm, wt6),
  * format date,
  * json escape,
  * extract preferred language comparing two lists,
  * turn to lower or upper chars,
  * deal with stick tables.

.. _channel_class:

Channel class
=============

.. js:class:: Channel

  **context**: action, sample-fetch, convert, filter

  HAProxy uses two buffers for the processing of the requests. The first one is
  used with the request data (from the client to the server) and the second is
  used for the response data (from the server to the client).

  Each buffer contains two types of data. The first type is the incoming data
  waiting for a processing. The second part is the outgoing data already
  processed. Usually, the incoming data is processed, after it is tagged as
  outgoing data, and finally it is sent. The following functions provides tools
  for manipulating these data in a buffer.

  The following diagram shows where the channel class function are applied.

  .. image:: _static/channel.png

  .. warning::
    It is not possible to read from the response in request action, and it is
    not possible to read from the request channel in response action.

  .. warning::
    It is forbidden to alter the Channels buffer from HTTP contexts.  So only
    :js:func:`Channel.input`, :js:func:`Channel.output`,
    :js:func:`Channel.may_recv`, :js:func:`Channel.is_full` and
    :js:func:`Channel.is_resp` can be called from a HTTP context.

  All the functions provided by this class are available in the
  **sample-fetches**, **actions** and **filters** contexts. For **filters**,
  incoming data (offset and length) are relative to the filter. Some functions
  may yield, but only for **actions**. Yield is not possible for
  **sample-fetches**, **converters** and **filters**.

.. js:function:: Channel.append(channel, string)

  This function copies the string **string** at the end of incoming data of the
  channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if
  data cannot be copied.

  Same that :js:func:`Channel.insert(channel, string, channel:input())`.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param string string: The data to copy at the end of incoming data.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: Channel.data(channel [, offset [, length]])

  This function returns **length** bytes of incoming data from the channel
  buffer, starting at the offset **offset**. The data are not removed from the
  buffer.

  By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data found, starting at the
  given offset, are returned. If **length** is set to -1, the function tries to
  retrieve a maximum of data and, if called by an action, it yields if
  necessary. It also waits for more data if the requested length exceeds the
  available amount of incoming data. Not providing an offset is the same as
  setting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming
  data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

  If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil'
  value is returned.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data to start to get
   data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming
   data.
  :param integer length: *optional* The expected length of data to retrieve. All
   incoming data by default. May be set to -1 to get a maximum of data.
  :returns: a string containing the data found or nil.

.. js:function:: Channel.forward(channel, length)

  This function forwards **length** bytes of data from the channel buffer. If
  the requested length exceeds the available amount of incoming data, and if
  called by an action, the function yields, waiting for more data to forward. It
  returns the amount of data forwarded.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param integer int: The amount of data to forward.

.. js:function:: Channel.input(channel)

  This function returns the length of incoming data in the channel buffer. When
  called by a filter, this value is relative to the filter.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

.. js:function:: Channel.insert(channel, string [, offset])

  This function copies the string **string** at the offset **offset** in
  incoming data of the channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on
  success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

  By default, if no offset is provided, the string is copied in front of
  incoming data. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data
  of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to their end.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param string string: The data to copy into incoming data.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data where to copy
   data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming
   data.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: Channel.is_full(channel)

  This function returns true if the channel buffer is full.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :returns: a boolean

.. js:function:: Channel.is_resp(channel)

  This function returns true if the channel is the response one.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :returns: a boolean

.. js:function:: Channel.line(channel [, offset [, length]])

  This function parses **length** bytes of incoming data of the channel buffer,
  starting at offset **offset**, and returns the first line found, including the
  '\\n'.  The data are not removed from the buffer. If no line is found, all
  data are returned.

  By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given
  offset, are evaluated. If **length** is set to -1, the function tries to
  retrieve a maximum of data and, if called by an action, yields if
  necessary. It also waits for more data if the requested length exceeds the
  available amount of incoming data. Not providing an offset is the same as
  setting it to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming
  data of the channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

  If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil'
  value is returned.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data to start to
   parse data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of
   incoming data.
  :param integer length: *optional* The length of data to parse. All incoming
   data by default. May be set to -1 to get a maximum of data.
  :returns: a string containing the line found or nil.

  :returns: an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

.. js:function:: Channel.prepend(channel, string)

  This function copies the string **string** in front of incoming data of the
  channel buffer. The function returns the copied length on success or -1 if
  data cannot be copied.

  Same that :js:func:`Channel.insert(channel, string, 0)`.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param string string: The data to copy in front of incoming data.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: Channel.remove(channel [, offset [, length]])

  This function removes **length** bytes of incoming data of the channel buffer,
  starting at offset **offset**. This function returns number of bytes removed
  on success.

  By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given
  offset, are removed. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it
  to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the
  channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data where to start
   to remove data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of
   incoming data.
  :param integer length: *optional* The length of data to remove. All incoming
   data by default.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes removed.

.. js:function:: Channel.send(channel, string)

  This function requires immediate send of the string **string**. It means the
  string is copied at the beginning of incoming data of the channel buffer and
  immediately forwarded. Unless if the connection is close, and if called by an
  action, this function yields to copy and forward all the string.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param string string: The data to send.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: Channel.set(channel, string [, offset [, length]])

  This function replaces **length** bytes of incoming data of the channel
  buffer, starting at offset **offset**, by the string **string**. The function
  returns the copied length on success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

  By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data, starting at the given
  offset, are replaced. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it
  to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the
  channel buffer while negative offset is relative to the end.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.
  :param string string: The data to copy into incoming data.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data where to start
   the data replacement. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the
   end of incoming data.
  :param integer length: *optional* The length of data to replace. All incoming
   data by default.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: Channel.dup(channel)

  **DEPRECATED**

  This function returns all incoming data found in the channel buffer. The data
  are not removed from the buffer and can be reprocessed later.

  If there is no incoming data and the channel can't receive more data, a 'nil'
  value is returned.

  :param class_channel channel: The manipulated Channel.

.. js:function:: TXN.log(TXN, loglevel, msg)

  This function sends a log. The log is sent, according with the HAProxy
  configuration file, to the loggers relevant to the current context and
  to stderr if it is allowed.

  The exact behaviour depends on tune.lua.log.loggers and tune.lua.log.stderr.

  :param class_txn txn: The class txn object containing the data.
  :param integer loglevel: Is the log level associated with the message. It is
   a number between 0 and 7.

  end
..

.. js:function:: TXN.Info(txn, msg)

  :param class_txn txn: The class txn object containing the data.

  end
..

.. js:function:: TXN.get_priv(txn)

  Return Lua data stored in the current transaction (with the `TXN.set_priv()`)
  function. If no data are stored, it returns a nil value.

  :param class_txn txn: The class txn object containing the data.
  :returns: the opaque data previously stored, or nil if nothing is
   available.

  :param string var: The variable name according with the HAProxy variable
   syntax.
  :param type value: The value associated to the variable. The type can be
   string or integer.

.. js:function:: TXN.reply([reply])

  Return a new reply object

  :param table reply: A table containing info to initialize the reply fields.
  :returns: A :ref:`reply_class` object.

  The table used to initialized the reply object may contain following entries :

  * status : The reply status code. the code 200 is used by default.
  * reason : The reply reason. The reason corresponding to the status code is
    used by default.
  * headers : A list of headers, indexed by header name. Empty by default. For
    a given name, multiple values are possible, stored in an ordered list.
  * body : The reply body, empty by default.

.. code-block:: lua

  local reply = txn:reply{
      status  = 400,
      reason  = "Bad request",
      headers = {
          ["content-type"]  = { "text/html" },
          ["cache-control"] = {"no-cache", "no-store" }
      },
      body = "<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>"
  }
..
  :see: :js:class:`Reply`

.. js:function:: TXN.done(txn[, reply])

  This function terminates processing of the transaction and the associated
  session and optionally reply to the client for HTTP sessions.

  :param class_txn txn: The class txn object containing the data.
  :param class_reply reply: The class reply object to return to the client.

  This functions can be used when a critical error is detected or to terminate
  processing after some data have been returned to the client (eg: a redirect).
  To do so, a reply may be provided. This object is optional and may contain a
  status code, a reason, a header list and a body. All these fields are
  optional. When not provided, the default values are used. By default, with an
  empty reply object, an empty HTTP 200 response is returned to the client. If
  no reply object is provided, the transaction is terminated without any
  reply. If a reply object is provided, it must not exceed the buffer size once
  converted into the internal HTTP representation. Because for now there is no
  easy way to be sure it fits, it is probably better to keep it reasonably
  small.

  The reply object may be fully created in lua or the class Reply may be used to
  create it.

.. code-block:: lua

  local reply = txn:reply()
  reply:set_status(400, "Bad request")
  reply:add_header("content-type", "text/html")
  reply:add_header("cache-control", "no-cache")
  reply:add_header("cache-control", "no-store")
  reply:set_body("<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>")
  txn:done(reply)
..

.. code-block:: lua

   txn:done{
       status  = 400,
       reason  = "Bad request",
       headers = {
           ["content-type"]  = { "text/html" },
           ["cache-control"] = { "no-cache", "no-store" },
       },
       body = "<html><body><h1>invalid request<h1></body></html>"
   }
..

  .. warning::
    It does not make sense to call this function from sample-fetches. In this
    case the behavior is the same than core.done(): it finishes the Lua
    execution. The transaction is really aborted only from an action registered
    function.

  :see: :js:func:`TXN.reply`, :js:class:`Reply`

.. js:function:: TXN.set_loglevel(txn, loglevel)

  Is used to change the log level of the current request. The "loglevel" must
  be an integer between 0 and 7.

  :param integer mark: The mark value.

.. js:function:: TXN.set_priority_class(txn, prio)

  This function adjusts the priority class of the transaction. The value should
  be within the range -2047..2047. Values outside this range will be
  truncated.

  "set-priority-class" for details.

.. js:function:: TXN.set_priority_offset(txn, prio)

  This function adjusts the priority offset of the transaction. The value
  should be within the range -524287..524287. Values outside this range will be
  truncated.

  "set-priority-offset" for details.

.. _reply_class:

Reply class
============

.. js:class:: Reply

  **context**: action

  This class represents a HTTP response message. It provides some methods to
  enrich it. Once converted into the internal HTTP representation, the response
  message must not exceed the buffer size. Because for now there is no
  easy way to be sure it fits, it is probably better to keep it reasonably
  small.

  See tune.bufsize in the configuration manual for details.

  :returns: Lua table

.. code-block:: lua

  {
    ["content-type"]  = { "text/html" },
    ["cache-control"] = {"no-cache", "no-store" },
    x_header_name     = { "value1", "value2", ... }
    ...
  }
..

.. js:attribute:: Reply.body

  The reply payload.

  :returns: string

.. js:function:: Reply.set_status(REPLY, status[, reason])

  Set the reply status code and optionally the reason-phrase. If the reason is
  not provided, the default reason corresponding to the status code is used.

  :param class_reply reply: The related Reply object.
  :param integer status: The reply status code.
  :param string reason: The reply status reason (optional).

.. js:function:: Reply.add_header(REPLY, name, value)

  Add a header to the reply object. If the header does not already exist, a new
  entry is created with its name as index and a one-element list containing its
  value as value. Otherwise, the header value is appended to the ordered list of
  values associated to the header name.

  :param class_reply reply: The related Reply object.
  :param string name: The header field name.
  :param string value: The header field value.

.. js:function:: Reply.del_header(REPLY, name)

  Remove all occurrences of a header name from the reply object.

  :param class_reply reply: The related Reply object.
  :param string name: The header field name.

.. js:function:: Reply.set_body(REPLY, body)

  Set the reply payload.

  :param class_reply reply: The related Reply object.
  :param string body: The reply payload.

.. _socket_class:

Socket class
============

.. js:class:: Socket

  This class must be compatible with the Lua Socket class. Only the 'client'
  functions are available. See the Lua Socket documentation:

  `http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/tcp.html
  <http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/tcp.html>`_

.. js:function:: Socket.close(socket)

  Closes a TCP object. The internal socket used by the object is closed and the
  local address to which the object was bound is made available to other
  applications. No further operations (except for further calls to the close
  method) are allowed on a closed Socket.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.

  Note: It is important to close all used sockets once they are not needed,
  since, in many systems, each socket uses a file descriptor, which are limited
  system resources. Garbage-collected objects are automatically closed before
  destruction, though.

.. js:function:: Socket.connect(socket, address[, port])

  Attempts to connect a socket object to a remote host.


  In case of error, the method returns nil followed by a string describing the
  error. In case of success, the method returns 1.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param string address: can be an IP address or a host name. See below for more
   information.
  :param integer port: must be an integer number in the range [1..64K].
  :returns: 1 or nil.

  An address field extension permits to use the connect() function to connect to
  other stream than TCP. The syntax containing a simpleipv4 or ipv6 address is
  the basically expected format. This format requires the port.

  Other format accepted are a socket path like "/socket/path", it permits to
  connect to a socket. Abstract namespaces are supported with the prefix
  "abns@", and finally a file descriptor can be passed with the prefix "fd@".
  The prefix "ipv4@", "ipv6@" and "unix@" are also supported. The port can be
  passed int the string. The syntax "127.0.0.1:1234" is valid. In this case, the
  parameter *port* must not be set.

.. js:function:: Socket.connect_ssl(socket, address, port)

  Same behavior than the function socket:connect, but uses SSL.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: 1 or nil.

.. js:function:: Socket.getpeername(socket)

  Returns information about the remote side of a connected client object.

  Returns a string with the IP address of the peer, followed by the port number
  that peer is using for the connection. In case of error, the method returns
  nil.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: a string containing the server information.

.. js:function:: Socket.getsockname(socket)

  Returns the local address information associated to the object.

  The method returns a string with local IP address and a number with the port.
  In case of error, the method returns nil.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :returns: a string containing the client information.

.. js:function:: Socket.receive(socket, [pattern [, prefix]])

  Reads data from a client object, according to the specified read pattern.
  Patterns follow the Lua file I/O format, and the difference in performance
  between all patterns is negligible.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param string|integer pattern: Describe what is required (see below).
  :param string prefix: A string which will be prefix the returned data.
  :returns:  a string containing the required data or nil.

  Pattern can be any of the following:

  * **`*a`**: reads from the socket until the connection is closed. No
              end-of-line translation is performed;

  * **`*l`**: reads a line of text from the Socket. The line is terminated by a
              LF character (ASCII 10), optionally preceded by a CR character
              (ASCII 13). The CR and LF characters are not included in the
              returned line.  In fact, all CR characters are ignored by the
              pattern. This is the default pattern.

  * **number**: causes the method to read a specified number of bytes from the
                Socket. Prefix is an optional string to be concatenated to the
                beginning of any received data before return.

  * **empty**: If the pattern is left empty, the default option is `*l`.

  If successful, the method returns the received pattern. In case of error, the
  method returns nil followed by an error message which can be the string
  'closed' in case the connection was closed before the transmission was
  completed or the string 'timeout' in case there was a timeout during the
  operation. Also, after the error message, the function returns the partial
  result of the transmission.

  Important note: This function was changed severely. It used to support
  multiple patterns (but I have never seen this feature used) and now it
  doesn't anymore.  Partial results used to be returned in the same way as
  successful results. This last feature violated the idea that all functions
  should return nil on error.  Thus it was changed too.

.. js:function:: Socket.send(socket, data [, start [, end ]])

  Sends data through client object.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param string data: The data that will be sent.
  :param integer start: The start position in the buffer of the data which will
   be sent.
  :param integer end: The end position in the buffer of the data which will
   be sent.
  :returns: see below.

  Data is the string to be sent. The optional arguments i and j work exactly
  like the standard string.sub Lua function to allow the selection of a
  substring to be sent.

  If successful, the method returns the index of the last byte within [start,
  end] that has been sent. Notice that, if start is 1 or absent, this is
  effectively the total number of bytes sent. In case of error, the method
  returns nil, followed by an error message, followed by the index of the last
  byte within [start, end] that has been sent. You might want to try again from
  the byte following that. The error message can be 'closed' in case the
  connection was closed before the transmission was completed or the string
  'timeout' in case there was a timeout during the operation.

  Note: Output is not buffered. For small strings, it is always better to
  concatenate them in Lua (with the '..' operator) and send the result in one
  call instead of calling the method several times.

.. js:function:: Socket.setoption(socket, option [, value])

  Just implemented for compatibility, this cal does nothing.

.. js:function:: Socket.settimeout(socket, value [, mode])

  Changes the timeout values for the object. All I/O operations are blocking.
  That is, any call to the methods send, receive, and accept will block
  indefinitely, until the operation completes. The settimeout method defines a
  limit on the amount of time the I/O methods can block. When a timeout time
  has elapsed, the affected methods give up and fail with an error code.

  The amount of time to wait is specified as the value parameter, in seconds.

  The timeout modes are not implemented, the only settable timeout is the
  inactivity time waiting for complete the internal buffer send or waiting for
  receive data.

  :param class_socket socket: Is the manipulated Socket.
  :param float value: The timeout value. Use floating point to specify
   milliseconds.

.. _regex_class:

Regex class
===========

.. js:class:: Regex

  This class allows the usage of HAProxy regexes because classic lua doesn't
  provides regexes. This class inherits the HAProxy compilation options, so the
  regexes can be libc regex, pcre regex or pcre JIT regex.

  The expression matching number is limited to 20 per regex. The only available
  option is case sensitive.

  Because regexes compilation is a heavy process, it is better to define all
  your regexes in the **body context** and use it during the runtime.

.. code-block:: lua

  -- Create the regex
  st, regex = Regex.new("needle (..) (...)", true);

  -- Check compilation errors
  if st == false then
    print "error: " .. regex
  end

  -- Match the regexes
  print(regex:exec("Looking for a needle in the haystack")) -- true
  print(regex:exec("Lokking for a cat in the haystack"))    -- false

  -- Extract words
  st, list = regex:match("Looking for a needle in the haystack")
  print(st)      -- true
  print(list[1]) -- needle in the
  print(list[2]) -- in
  print(list[3]) -- the

.. js:function:: Regex.new(regex, case_sensitive)

  Create and compile a regex.

  :param string regex: The regular expression according with the libc or pcre
   standard
  :param boolean case_sensitive: Match is case sensitive or not.
  :returns: boolean status and :ref:`regex_class` or string containing fail
   reason.

.. js:function:: Regex.exec(regex, str)

  Execute the regex.

  :param class_regex regex: A :ref:`regex_class` object.
  :param string str: The input string will be compared with the compiled regex.
  :returns: a boolean status according with the match result.

.. js:function:: Regex.match(regex, str)

  Execute the regex and return matched expressions.

  :param class_map map: A :ref:`regex_class` object.
  :param string str: The input string will be compared with the compiled regex.
  :returns: a boolean status according with the match result, and
   a table containing all the string matched in order of declaration.

.. _map_class:

Map class
=========

.. js:class:: Map

  This class permits to do some lookups in HAProxy maps. The declared maps can
  be modified during the runtime through the HAProxy management socket.

.. code-block:: lua

  default = "usa"

  -- Create and load map
  geo = Map.new("geo.map", Map._ip);

  -- Create new fetch that returns the user country
  core.register_fetches("country", function(txn)
    local src;
    local loc;

    src = txn.f:fhdr("x-forwarded-for");
    if (src == nil) then
      src = txn.f:src()
      if (src == nil) then
        return default;
      end
    end

    -- Perform lookup
    loc = geo:lookup(src);

    if (loc == nil) then
      return default;
    end

    return loc;
  end);

.. _applethttp_class:

AppletHTTP class
================

.. js:class:: AppletHTTP

  This class is used with applets that requires the 'http' mode. The http applet
  can be registered with the *core.register_service()* function. They are used
  for processing an http request like a server in back of HAProxy.

  This is an hello world sample code:

.. code-block:: lua

  core.register_service("hello-world", "http", function(applet)
     local response = "Hello World !"

.. _sticktable_class:

StickTable class
================

.. js:class:: StickTable

  **context**: task, action, sample-fetch

  This class can be used to access the HAProxy stick tables from Lua.

.. js:function:: StickTable.info()

  Returns stick table attributes as a Lua table. See HAProxy documentation for
  "stick-table" for canonical info, or check out example below.

  :returns: Lua table

  Assume our table has IPv4 key and gpc0 and conn_rate "columns":

.. code-block:: lua

  {
    expire=<int>,  # Value in ms
    size=<int>,    # Maximum table size
    used=<int>,    # Actual number of entries in table
    data={         # Data columns, with types as key, and periods as values
                     (-1 if type is not rate counter)
      conn_rate=<int>,
      gpc0=-1
    },
    length=<int>,  # max string length for string table keys, key length
                   # otherwise
    nopurge=<boolean>, # purge oldest entries when table is full
    type="ip"      # can be "ip", "ipv6", "integer", "string", "binary"
  }

.. js:function:: StickTable.lookup(key)

   Returns stick table entry for given <key>

   :param string key: Stick table key (IP addresses and strings are supported)
   :returns: Lua table

.. js:function:: StickTable.dump([filter])

   Returns all entries in stick table. An optional filter can be used
   to extract entries with specific data values. Filter is a table with valid
   comparison operators as keys followed by data type name and value pairs.
   Check out the HAProxy docs for "show table" for more details. For the
   reference, the supported operators are:

     "eq", "ne", "le", "lt", "ge", "gt"

   For large tables, execution of this function can take a long time (for
   HAProxy standards). That's also true when filter is used, so take care and
   measure the impact.

   :param table filter: Stick table filter
   :returns: Stick table entries (table)

   See below for example filter, which contains 4 entries (or comparisons).
   (Maximum number of filter entries is 4, defined in the source code)

.. code-block:: lua

    local filter = {
      {"gpc0", "gt", 30}, {"gpc1", "gt", 20}}, {"conn_rate", "le", 10}
    }

.. _action_class:

Action class
=============

.. js:class:: Act

  **context**: action

  This class contains all return codes an action may return. It is the lua
  equivalent to HAProxy "ACT_RET_*" code.

.. code-block:: lua

  core.register_action("deny", { "http-req" }, function (txn)
      return act.DENY
   end)
..
.. js:attribute:: act.CONTINUE

  This attribute is an integer (0). It instructs HAProxy to continue the
  current ruleset processing on the message. It is the default return code
  for a lua action.

  :returns: integer

.. js:attribute:: act.STOP

  This attribute is an integer (1). It instructs HAProxy to stop the current
  ruleset processing on the message.

.. js:attribute:: act.YIELD

  This attribute is an integer (2). It instructs HAProxy to temporarily pause
  the message processing. It will be resumed later on the same rule. The
  corresponding lua script is re-executed for the start.

.. js:attribute:: act.ERROR

  This attribute is an integer (3). It triggers an internal errors The message
  processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an
  HTTP 500 error is returned to the client.

  :returns: integer

.. js:attribute:: act.DONE

  This attribute is an integer (4). It instructs HAProxy to stop the message
  processing.

  :returns: integer

.. js:attribute:: act.DENY

  This attribute is an integer (5). It denies the current message. The message
  processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an
  HTTP 403 error is returned to the client if the deny is returned during the
  request analysis. During the response analysis, a HTTP 502 error is returned
  and the server response is discarded.

  :returns: integer

.. js:attribute:: act.ABORT

  This attribute is an integer (6). It aborts the current message. The message
  processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams,
  HAProxy assumes a response was already sent to the client. From the Lua
  actions point of view, when this code is used, the transaction is terminated
  with no reply.

  :returns: integer

.. js:attribute:: act.INVALID

  This attribute is an integer (7). It triggers an internal errors. The message
  processing is stopped and the transaction is terminated. For HTTP streams, an
  HTTP 400 error is returned to the client if the error is returned during the
  request analysis. During the response analysis, a HTTP 502 error is returned
  and the server response is discarded.

  :returns: integer

.. js:function:: act:wake_time(milliseconds)

  **context**: action

  Set the script pause timeout to the specified time, defined in
  milliseconds.

  :param integer milliseconds: the required milliseconds.

  This function may be used when a lua action returns `act.YIELD`, to force its
  wake-up at most after the specified number of milliseconds.

.. _filter_class:

Filter class
=============

.. js:class:: filter

  **context**: filter

  This class contains return codes some filter callback functions may return. It
  also contains configuration flags and some helper functions. To understand how
  the filter API works, see `doc/internal/filters.txt` documentation.

.. js:attribute:: filter.CONTINUE

  This attribute is an integer (1). It may be returned by some filter callback
  functions to instruct this filtering step is finished for this filter.

.. js:attribute:: filter.WAIT

  This attribute is an integer (0). It may be returned by some filter callback
  functions to instruct the filtering must be paused, waiting for more data or
  for an external event depending on this filter.

.. js:attribute:: filter.ERROR

  This attribute is an integer (-1). It may be returned by some filter callback
  functions to trigger an error.

.. js:attribute:: filter.FLT_CFG_FL_HTX

  This attribute is a flag corresponding to the filter flag FLT_CFG_FL_HTX. When
  it is set for a filter, it means the filter is able to filter HTTP streams.

.. js:function:: filter.register_data_filter(chn)

  **context**: filter

  Enable the data filtering on the channel **chn** for the current filter. It
  may be called at any time from any callback functions proceeding the data
  analysis.

  :param class_Channel chn: A :ref:`channel_class`.

.. js:function:: filter.unregister_data_filter(chn)

  **context**: filter

  Disable the data filtering on the channel **chn** for the current filter. It
  may be called at any time from any callback functions.

  :param class_Channel chn: A :ref:`channel_class`.

.. js:function:: filter.wake_time(milliseconds)

  **context**: filter

  Set the script pause timeout to the specified time, defined in
  milliseconds.

  :param integer milliseconds: the required milliseconds.

  This function may be used from any lua filter callback function to force its
  wake-up at most after the specified number of milliseconds. Especially, when
  `filter.CONTINUE` is returned.


A filters is declared using :js:func:`core.register_filter()` function. The
provided class will be used to instantiate filters. It may define following
attributes:

* id: The filter identifier. It is a string that identifies the filter and is
      optional.

* flags: The filter flags. Only :js:attr:`filter.FLT_CFG_FL_HTX` may be set
         for now.

Such filter class must also define all required callback functions in the
following list. Note that :js:func:`Filter.new()` must be defined otherwise the
filter is ignored. Others are optional.

* .. js:function:: FILTER.new()

  Called to instantiate a new filter. This function must be defined.

  :returns: a Lua object that will be used as filter instance for the current
            stream.

* .. js:function:: FILTER.start_analyze(flt, txn, chn)

  Called when the analysis starts on the channel **chn**.

* .. js:function:: FILTER.end_analyze(flt, txn, chn)

  Called when the analysis ends on the channel **chn**.

.. _httpmessage_class:

HTTPMessage class
===================

.. js:class:: HTTPMessage

  **context**: filter

  This class contains all functions to manipulate a HTTP message. For now, this
  class is only available from a filter context.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.add_header(http_msg, name, value)

  Appends a HTTP header field in the HTTP message **http_msg** whose name is
  specified in **name** and whose value is defined in **value**.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param string name: The header name.
  :param string value: The header value.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.append(http_msg, string)

  This function copies the string **string** at the end of incoming data of the
  HTTP message **http_msg**. The function returns the copied length on success
  or -1 if data cannot be copied.

  Same that :js:func:`HTTPMessage.insert(http_msg, string, http_msg:input())`.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param string string: The data to copy at the end of incoming data.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of bytes copied or -1.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.body(http_msgl[, offset[, length]])

  This function returns **length** bytes of incoming data from the HTTP message
  **http_msg**, starting at the offset **offset**. The data are not removed from
  the buffer.

  By default, if no length is provided, all incoming data found, starting at the
  given offset, are returned. If **length** is set to -1, the function tries to
  retrieve a maximum of data. Because it is called in the filter context, it
  never yield. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it to 0. A
  positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the
  http_message buffer while negative offset is relative to their end.

  If there is no incoming data and the HTTP message can't receive more data,
  a 'nil' value is returned.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data to start to get
   data. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the end of incoming
   data.
  :param integer length: *optional* The expected length of data to retrieve.
   All incoming data by default. May be set to -1 to get a maximum of data.
  :returns: a string containing the data found or nil.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.eom(http_msg)

  This function returns true if the end of message is reached for the HTTP
  message **http_msg**.

  :returns: an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.del_header(http_msg, name)

  Removes all HTTP header fields in the HTTP message **http_msg** whose name is
  specified in **name**.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated http message.
  :param string name: The header name.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.get_headers(http_msg)

  Returns a table containing all the headers of the HTTP message **http_msg**.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated http message.
  :returns: table of headers.

  This is the form of the returned table:

.. code-block:: lua

  http_msg:get_headers()['<header-name>'][<header-index>] = "<header-value>"

  local hdr = http_msg:get_headers()
  hdr["host"][0] = "www.test.com"
  hdr["accept"][0] = "audio/basic q=1"
  hdr["accept"][1] = "audio/*, q=0.2"
  hdr["accept"][2] = "*.*, q=0.1"
..

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.get_stline(http_msg)

  Returns a table containing the start-line of the HTTP message **http_msg**.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated http message.
  :returns: the start-line.

  This is the form of the returned table:

.. code-block:: lua

  -- for the request :
  {"method" = string, "uri" = string, "version" = string}

  -- for the response:
  {"version" = string, "code" = string, "reason" = string}
..

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.forward(http_msg, length)

  This function forwards **length** bytes of data from the HTTP message
  **http_msg**. Because it is called in the filter context, it never yields. Only
  available incoming data may be forwarded, event if the requested length
  exceeds the available amount of incoming data. It returns the amount of data
  forwarded.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param integer int: The amount of data to forward.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.input(http_msg)

  This function returns the length of incoming data in the HTTP message
  **http_msg** from the filter point of view.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :returns: an integer containing the amount of available bytes.

.. js:function:: HTTPMessage.insert(http_msg, string[, offset])

  This function copies the string **string** at the offset **offset** in
  incoming data of the HTTP message **http_msg**. The function returns the
  copied length on success or -1 if data cannot be copied.

  By default, if no offset is provided, the string is copied in front of
  incoming data. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data
  of the HTTP message while negative offset is relative to their end.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param string string: The data to copy into incoming data.

  offset, are replaced. Not providing an offset is the same as setting it
  to 0. A positive offset is relative to the beginning of incoming data of the
  HTTP message while negative offset is relative to the end.

  :param class_httpmessage http_msg: The manipulated HTTP message.
  :param string string: The data to copy into incoming data.
  :param integer offset: *optional* The offset in incoming data where to start
   the data replacement. 0 by default. May be negative to be relative to the

External Lua libraries
======================

A lot of useful lua libraries can be found here:

* Lua toolbox has been superseded by
  `https://luarocks.org/ <https://luarocks.org/>`_

  The old lua toolbox source code is still available here
  `https://github.com/catwell/lua-toolbox <https://github.com/catwell/lua-toolbox>`_ (DEPRECATED)

Redis client library:

* `https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua <https://github.com/nrk/redis-lua>`_

This is an example about the usage of the Redis library within HAProxy.
Note that each call to any function of this library can throw an error if
the socket connection fails.

.. code-block:: lua

    -- load the redis library
    local redis = require("redis");

    function do_something(txn)

       -- create and connect new tcp socket
       local tcp = core.tcp();
       tcp:settimeout(1);
       tcp:connect("127.0.0.1", 6379);

       -- use the redis library with this new socket
       local client = redis.connect({socket=tcp});
       client:ping();

    end
